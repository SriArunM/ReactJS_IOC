        <p id="p1">Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984) is a South African former international cricketer, and a current
        commentator. AB de Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year[2] three times during his 15-year international
        career and was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019.[3] He is regarded as one of the
        greatest cricketers in the history of the sport and as one of the best batsmen of his era.[4][5] de Villiers began his
        international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various
        positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Regarded as one of the most innovative and
        destructive batsmen in the modern era, de Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the
        wicket-keeper.[6]</p>
        <p id="p2">De Villiers captained South Africa in all three formats, although after a series of injuries, he stepped down from the
        Test captaincy. In 2017, he stepped down from captaining the national limited-overs games[9] and in May 2018, he
        announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket.[10][11][12] In January 2020, however, de Villiers
        expressed an interest in making an international comeback and play in the 2020 T20 World Cup,[13] although later in the
        year it was confirmed that he would not do so.[14][15][16] On 19 November 2021, de Villiers announced his retirement
        from all forms of cricket.[17]
